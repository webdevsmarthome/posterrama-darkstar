### Posterpacks

Posterpacks are **portable, self-contained ZIP bundles** that package artwork + metadata for a single item (movie, series, or game). They let you curate, override, and preserve the “perfect poster” experience—independent of your upstream sources.

<figure>
  <img src="./screenshots/posterpacks.png" alt="Posterpacks in Posterrama" width="740">
  <figcaption style="text-align:left; color:#6a6a6a;"><em>Create, upload, and manage posterpacks for movies, series, and games</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**Why posterpacks are awesome:**

- **Consistent artwork everywhere**: A posterpack can override mismatched posters/backgrounds from Plex/Jellyfin/TMDB and keep your displays looking intentional.
- **Fast + reliable**: Local assets reduce dependency on third‑party APIs, rate limits, and transient network failures.
- **Portable & shareable**: Move a curated pack to another Posterrama install, keep themed collections, or share them with friends (no “re-scraping” needed).
- **Great for events & curation**: Build seasonal sets (Halloween, Oscars, Studio Ghibli night), venue loops, or “featured” picks you can reuse.
- **Games included**: Posterpack support also extends to RomM-backed games for a clean games-only rotation in Wallart.

**How it works (high level):**

- **Generate** posterpacks from supported sources (Plex, Jellyfin/Emby, TMDB, RomM) or **upload your own** ZIPs.
- Posterrama automatically picks them up for **Screensaver, Wallart, and Cinema**—no manual unzipping needed.
- Posterpack “type” is validated so **game packs stay in game exports**, keeping libraries tidy and preventing wrong uploads.

### Dashboard

  <img src="./screenshots/media_sources.png" alt="Media Sources" width="740">
  <figcaption style="text-align:left; color:#6a6a6a;"><em>Connect your media sources easily</em></figcaption>
  
</figure>

Connect your Plex or Jellyfin / Emby server, add popular sources like TMDB, or showcase your game collection from RomM. Your collection is always up to date.

Local library: Add your own artwork with a simple upload—posters, cinematic backgrounds, motion posters, or complete posterpacks. You can also create shareable posterpacks directly from your Plex or Jellyfin / Emby libraries. New packs are picked up automatically—no unzipping or manual steps—and are instantly available in Screensaver, Wallart, and Cinema.

### Display Settings

<figure>
  <img src="./screenshots/display_settings.png" alt="Display Settings" width="740">
  <figcaption style="text-align:left; color:#6a6a6a;"><em>Fine-tune your display settings</em></figcaption>
  
</figure>

- Realtime preview — see changes instantly while you configure. Most settings hot‑reload without a restart; the display updates live as you tweak options.

### Device management

<figure>
  <img src="./screenshots/device_management.png" alt="Device Management" width="740">
  <figcaption style="text-align:left; color:#6a6a6a;"><em>Manage devices (BETA): status, profiles, bulk actions, and overrides</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Device Management (BETA) is the admin workspace for operating multiple Posterrama screens: see device health at a glance, organize devices by location/profile, and send operational actions without touching the displays.

What you can do:

- At‑a‑glance status: Live / Online / Offline / Unknown (plus “Powered off”), with device type, mode, resolution, version, and an optional now‑playing thumbnail
- Quick actions per device: power toggle, reload, clear cache, play/pause, open live logs, open remote control, and send a command
- Fleet operations: search + filter by status or location, select multiple devices, then run bulk actions (reload, clear cache, pairing codes, overrides, clear overrides, play/pause, delete)
- Organization: rename devices, assign a location, and assign a Device Profile (reusable Display Settings bundles)
- Per‑device Display Settings overrides: edit/clear overrides so a device can deviate from global + profile settings when needed

Where it shines:

- At home — keep different rooms in different modes, quickly pause/restore a screen, and troubleshoot a single device without affecting others
- In venues — manage a fleet with bulk actions, health visibility, and consistent look via profiles/locations
- For trusted kiosks — use the Settings tab’s IP Whitelist to let known screens skip registration and follow global Display Settings

### Home Assistant integration

<img src="./screenshots/home_assistant_mqtt.png" alt="Home Assistant MQTT Integration" width="370" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px;">

Connect your Posterrama displays to Home Assistant via MQTT and make them part of your smart home. Each display is exposed via Home Assistant MQTT Discovery as a set of entities (controls, sensors, settings, and a live poster preview), so you can automate and control screens from the HA UI you already use.

What you get:

- **Live poster preview**: A camera entity shows the current poster thumbnail per screen (useful for dashboards and wall tablets)
- **Instant controls**: Buttons/switches for play/pause, next/previous, power, pin/unpin, and quick actions
- **Deep customization**: Dozens of per-device settings exposed as switches, selects, numbers, and text inputs (mode, animations, overlays, timings, and more)
- **Real-time sync**: State updates and commands publish continuously, so HA stays in sync with what each screen is doing
- **Multi-screen friendly**: Each display becomes its own entity set, making it easy to automate one screen or orchestrate many

<br clear="left"/>

Perfect for:

- **Movie Night scenes**: Switch a hallway/foyer screen to Cinema mode when you start a movie
- **Presence automations**: Turn displays on when someone’s home, off at night (or when the house is away)
- **Dashboards & wall tablets**: See a live poster preview and control screens from a Lovelace view
- **Time-based routines**: Change modes/settings by schedule (daytime Wallart → evening Cinema → late-night dim)
- **Party / event mode**: Pin a specific poster, rotate faster, and keep multiple screens in sync

Setup is straightforward—enable MQTT in Posterrama settings, point it to your broker, and Home Assistant will discover the entities automatically (via MQTT Discovery). No manual YAML is required for basic control.

### Technical features

- Reverse‑proxy aware sessions and cookies (safe defaults for HTTPS termination / Cloudflare / nginx)
- Brute‑force protection on admin auth (rate limiting + hardened login flow)
- Configuration safety rails: schema validation + startup checks + clear error paths (fail fast instead of “half‑broken”)
- Built‑in backup/restore for critical state (config + devices/profiles) to recover quickly
- Multi-tier caching (memory + disk) designed to keep displays responsive even on slower storage or large libraries
- Real-time control channel with resilient device presence (WebSocket hub with heartbeat/online detection)
- Operational visibility: structured logs + in-app Notification Center + metrics endpoints for monitoring
- API-first architecture with documented contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger) for automation and integrations
- Safe file handling patterns (uploads/storage with defensive validation/locking to avoid corruption under concurrency)

## System requirements

**Minimum recommended:**

- **RAM**: 2GB minimum, 4GB+ recommended for larger libraries (5000+ items)
- **Storage**: 2GB for application + cache space for images
